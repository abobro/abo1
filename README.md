All the apps are made with Android Studio

Main_UI.zip includes all the four apps (Heartrate, map, speed/trip and acceleration) 

Heartrate.zip is an app for Polar heartbeat sensors.

Gps.zip is an app that presents your current location on map.

Gpio.zip is an app that presents your speed/trip

sensorgraphs.zip is an app that presents your acceleration. 

In Main_UI.zip and gps.zip you have to go to app-(src-main)-res-values-google_maps_api.xml 
and replace text "YOUR_KEY_HERE" with your own Google Maps API Key.

To get your own API Key follow the guide found behind this link:
